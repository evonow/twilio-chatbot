## COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES

### Can Reduce Costs By:
1. **Using existing libraries/frameworks**: Save 10-15% ($5,400 - $8,100)
2. **Phased delivery**: Build MVP first, add features later
3. **Skip optional features**: 
   - Google Docs integration: Save $1,200 - $1,500
   - Advanced FAQ analysis: Save $900 - $1,200
   - Performance optimization: Save $300 - $600
4. **Reduce testing scope**: Save 20-30% of testing costs ($900 - $1,800)

### MVP Version (Core Features Only):
- **Estimated Cost**: **$33,750 - $41,250**
- Includes: Basic RAG, file upload, chat interface, authentication
- Excludes: Advanced features, extensive testing, some integrations

## NOTES:
- All costs assume $75/hour rate
- Costs do not include infrastructure (Railway, Pinecone, OpenAI API costs)
- Estimates assume mid-level developers (2-5 years experience)
- Parallel work reduces total hours but not necessarily total cost
- Buffer accounts for debugging, refactoring, and unexpected issues
