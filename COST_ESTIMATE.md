## COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES

### Can Reduce Costs By:
1. **Using existing libraries/frameworks**: Save 10-15% ($7,200 - $10,800)
2. **Phased delivery**: Build MVP first, add features later
3. **Skip optional features**: 
   - Google Docs integration: Save $1,600 - $2,000
   - Advanced FAQ analysis: Save $1,200 - $1,600
   - Performance optimization: Save $400 - $800
4. **Reduce testing scope**: Save 20-30% of testing costs ($1,200 - $2,400)

### MVP Version (Core Features Only):
- **Estimated Cost**: **$45,000 - $55,000**
- Includes: Basic RAG, file upload, chat interface, authentication
- Excludes: Advanced features, extensive testing, some integrations

## NOTES:
- All costs assume $100/hour rate
- Costs do not include infrastructure (Railway, Pinecone, OpenAI API costs)
- Estimates assume mid-level developers (2-5 years experience)
- Parallel work reduces total hours but not necessarily total cost
- Buffer accounts for debugging, refactoring, and unexpected issues
